# IT-Home-Lab

This repository documents my personal IT Home Lab built using VirtualBox.
It includes a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller (DC01) and a Windows 11 Pro Client (CLIENT01).

The lab simulates a small business IT environment to practice 1st Line / Junior IT Support tasks.

## Skills Practiced
- Active Directory user management (creating, disabling, unlocking users)
- Password resets
- Joining clients to a domain
- Mapping network drives
- Printer setup and testing
- Troubleshooting common IT issues

## Repository Structure
